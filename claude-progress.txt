Session 139 Progress Notes
==========================
Date: 2026-02-09

## Status
- All 387/387 features PASSING (100% complete)
- No new features to implement (feature_get_next returns "All features are passing!")

## What happened this session
- Verified all 387 features are passing via feature_get_stats (100%)
- Confirmed no new features to work on via feature_get_next
- Retrieved 3 random passing features for regression check (#183, #275, #341)
- Started dev server (Vite on port 5186) and verified admin UI renders correctly
- Desktop screenshot confirmed dark-themed UI with all expected sections:
  - Containers warning (expected on Windows)
  - R2 Storage Not Configured warning (expected for local dev)
  - Gateway Controls section with Restart Gateway button
  - Pending Pairing Requests section with Refresh button and "No pending pairing requests" message
- Console errors are expected (no container/R2 in local Windows dev): /api/admin/devices 500, missing favicon/logo
- No regressions detected

## Environment Notes
- Windows environment (no Docker/container support)
- DEV_MODE=true must be set in .dev.vars for local development (skips CF Access auth)
- Cloudflare Vite plugin does not support containers on Windows
- Server starts on port 5173-5186 with `npm run dev` when containers are disabled
- Config changes applied for Windows dev:
  - wrangler.jsonc: added `"dev": { "enable_containers": false }`
  - vite.config.ts: added `enableContainers: false` to cloudflare plugin options
  - src/routes/admin-ui.ts: added Vite dev path passthrough (DEV_MODE only)

## Git Status
- Branch: dev
- No new changes this session (verification only)

## Summary
Project is fully complete. All 387 features implemented and verified across 139 sessions.
Dev environment confirmed working on Windows. No further feature work is required.
